### Calculate Funding Quota

The Funding Quota will be 10 times of your asset value deposited into MappedSwap and it will be on USDM basis.
`Total Tradable Amount = Total Deposit + Funding Quota`

:::tip For instance:

1. If you deposit 100USDM to MappedSwap, your Funding Quota will be 10 times of your total deposit = 1,000USDM. Therefore, the total tradable value is: 

`Total Tradable Amount = 100USDM + 1,000USDM = 1,100USDM`

2. If you deposit 1BTCM to MappedSwap, and the price of BTCM at that time is 50,000USDM, your Funding Quota will be 10 times of your total deposit = 500,000USDM. Therefore, the total tradable value is:

`Total Tradable Amount = 50,000USDM + 500,000USDM = 550,000USDM`

3. ETHM adopts the same calculation logic.
